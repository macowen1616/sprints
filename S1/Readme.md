# World Series Winners Analysis

Add a description of your project here.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Create the enviornment using Pandas, VS code.
2. use the libraries to import the data.
3. Use sqlite3 to create the database and tables with pandas

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use Pandas to read the csv file.
2. sqlite3 to create the database.
3. Run and test the code frequently to make sure it is working properly and find similarities between the teams.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Pandas 
* sqlite3
* Math

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* I plan on cleaning up the code. Some of the code starts off as zero instead of one. I am going to make it more readable and consistent.
* I also want to make the world Series Predictor more accurate by finding more data and similarities between the most successful teams between 2000-2016.
