# California Housing

My project is dissecting data and putting it together in a meaningful way. I am comparing locations with prices with the average housing cost, median salary, and etc. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. I used both Pandas and Quarto, which benefited the layout of the project by creating graphs and tables. 
2. I used VSCode, which was helpful with the environment. 
3. The code runs smoothly. Once you input the csv file, the graphs will load in and display the data.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the first code to load the data from the housing.csv file.
2. Each paragraph of code is run individually to display tables and graphs that interpret the data.
3. Review the data and see the correlations between specific stats.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You need pandas, quarto, and VS Code. 
*

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to clean the data and create a better scope for the dates. 
* [ ] I want to change the longitude and latitude coordinates to actual cities.
* [ ] Convert the rooms into homes rather than estimating room cost.
